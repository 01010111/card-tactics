# Card Ideas

- Schmiel : Ooo, you could do high risk synergy sets! Where gear gives a bonus to each other if they're both equipped but they use the same suits. So you're less likely to have enough cards to play all moves optimally
- Do static amt of damage, 50% chance to return card
- Reshuffle cards
- Card cloner (J -> J, J)
- Split card (5 -> 1,4 | 2,3)
- Draw (num cards) + 1
- Mutations
  - Damage surroundings when all cards/gear are used
  - Heal on all gear used
  - Radiate suit weakness to nearby gear
